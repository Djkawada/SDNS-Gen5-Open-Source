# Secure NVMe Boot Selector (SDNS) - Open Source PCIe Gen 5.0 Project üöÄ

The SDNS project aims to create the world's first **fully isolated, purely hardware-based** boot selector for multiple M.2 NVMe SSDs, operating at full **PCIe Gen 5.0 x4** speed.

This project offers the ultimate solution for multi-boot security by electrically isolating inactive operating systems, eliminating the risk of cross-corruption and software bootloader dependency.

## üîç Core Challenge

The non-negotiable requirement of **PCIe Gen 5.0 (32 GT/s)** across a cabled connection ($\approx 30 \text{ cm}$) makes this an **advanced Signal Integrity (SI)** challenge. The core design relies on successful implementation of **Retimer** and **MUX** circuitry to maintain speed and stability.
